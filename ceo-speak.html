          <p class="mt-40"><b>I am delighted by the all–round improvement in performance of our underground mines.</b> Rampura Agucha has accelerated from 2.0 million MT a year ago to 3.3 million MT exiting the year at 4.0 million MT per annum run rate. Sindesar Khurd has been consistently delivering over 5.0 million MT run-rate with improving silver production. We have achieved record decline development in Sindesar Khurd, which will help in opening new blocks to sustain production going forward. With substantial improvement in infrastructure, Zawar mines are now at a run-rate of about 3.0 million MT from 2.2 million MT production in the previous year. At Rajpura Dariba mine, where we are upgrading the existing shaft and carrying out major infrastructure enhancements, ore production crossed 1.0 million MT and exited the year at a rate of 1.3 million MT. Kayad continues to operate at its rated capacity of 1.2 million MT. We are confident of reaching the design mined metal production capacity of 1.2 million MT in FY 2020.</p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p><b >It is gratifying to see our underground mines deliver mined metal of 936 kt, a growth of 29%, </b> almost matching last year’s aggregate mined metal production due to planned closure of open-cast operations.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >Once again, lead and silver production were at an all-time high of 198 kt and 679 MT respectively. </b>Lead and silver production were up 18% and 22% from previous year on the back of higher lead in ore, retrofitting of pyro metallurgical smelter to consume lead mined metal stocks and better silver grades. Zinc metal production fell by 12% during the year to 696 kt on account of lower availability of zinc mined metal for most part of the year as underground mines ramped up to fill the vacuum caused by planned closure of open-cast operations.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >I am pleased to inform that Hindustan Zinc is now the 9th largest producer of silver in the world,</b> up from 10th last year and 13th the year before, as per Thomson Reuters - Silver Institute. We are one of the fastest growing silver producers globally and with higher mine production and enhanced recoveries, we are targeting to be among top 5 global silver producers in the next 3 years.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >Fundamentals of zinc market continue to be robust.</b> Exchange stocks at 5 days of global consumption is the lowest since 2007. Zinc consumption has increased by 1.5 million MT in the last 6 years to over 14.3 million MT and expected to grow as China stimulates its economy to counter ongoing trade dispute. On the mine-side, supply has been stagnant at about 13 million MT since 2012 as new projects are coming in much slower than anticipated. We firmly believe that zinc has strong fundamentals as metal inventories will continue to remain low and market is not expected to reach balance for another 2 years, supporting an optimistic outlook for zinc price.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >We are now reaching the end of first phase of mine expansion to 1.2 million MT of mined metal, setting the foundation for future production growth.</b> Capital mine development across mines was a record 43 km, 12% higher from previous year. New mills were commissioned at Sindesar Khurd and Zawar making these locations self-sufficient. Paste fill capacity at Sindesar Khurd and Rampura Agucha have been doubled to enable faster filling of stopes and higher production. A paste filling plant at Zawar is under construction to enhance production and metal recovery. Rampura Agucha started hauling material from an innovative mid-shaft loading during the year, even as full shaft will become operational by Q2 FY 2020. Sindesar Khurd shaft was commissioned towards the end of the year and ore hauling is expected to start in the first quarter of the current year - both these shafts will significantly increase ore hauling capacity. Most importantly, our mines are now almost liberated of ventilation issues for lifetime as new ventilation systems were commissioned. Further, we have added higher capacity equipment at mines for higher productivity.</p>
          <h5 class="mt-45 prim-brown">It is gratifying to see our underground mines deliver mined metal of 936 kt, a growth of 29% almost matching last year’s aggregate mined metal production due to planned closure of open-cast operations.</h5>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >Digital transformation of mine is a business imperative for us with safety being the key driver. </b>Improving safety, productivity, maximising OEE and centralised monitoring are key pillars of the Digital Mine program we are currently pursuing. Sindesar Khurd Mine is leading the digitalisation journey and we are targeting to bring all our other mining operations to the same level. An integrated collaboration centre at Udaipur is under development to give a real time view of all our operations including mining, milling, smelting, CPPs and other functions. We are embracing the digital way of working to make our operations more productive and sustainable.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >We are addressing high risk activities in a structured way to make our operations safer. </b>To step up safety across the entire organisation, two major programs were started during the year. First, we have conceived a Safety Innovation Cell to integrate technology and safety to reduce high risk situations involving man-machine interactions and manual practices through engineering based solutions. Second, we have inducted ‘Fatality & Serious incident Prevention Plan’ as part of Aarohan, our umbrella safety program to address top five high risk areas of fall of ground, man-machine interaction, electric safety, fire and mine inrush. Through these initiatives, we are confident of reaching our goal of zero harm.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >We have conducted stability tests across our three tailing dams </b>with the help of global experts in addition to comprehensive internal audits by cross functional teams and recommendations from these are being addressed on a priority basis. Further, I would like to mention our efforts towards backfill at all our mines which will significantly reduce quantum of tailings flowing into dams as well as dry stack tailing plant at Zawar for better stability and water conservation.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >We continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts.</b>Renewable power is important for us in the context of our energy intensive operations. In continuation of our efforts to add solar power in waste land at our sites, 22 MW solar plant over a waste dump in Rampura Agucha became operational during the year taking our total solar capacity to 39 MW. Our renewable energy portfolio stands at 347 MW which provides reduction of over 730,000 MT of CO2 per annum and we plan to increase it further. To address water scarcity, we are trebling our sewage treatment plant capacity in Udaipur to 60 MLD by June 2019 treating over half of Udaipur city’s sewage and enhancing our water security through treated water while reducing fresh water usage.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >Gainful utilisation of waste </b>through paste filling plants for backfill of mines has made our mines more sustainable. Through technology interventions, bulk of our smelter and CPP waste is now gainfully utilised by cement industry and in highway construction. The impact of these efforts in reducing our environment and land footprint is enormous.</p>
          <p class="mt-45"><b >I am excited about our future growth prospects </b>as we expect to complete the massive underground mine expansion plan announced in early 2013 by the middle of the current financial year, quadrupling our mined metal production capacity to 1.2 million MT per annum during this period. Consequently, both mined metal and finished metal production in FY 2020 will likely be significantly higher than last year and expected to be about 1.0 million MT each. Further, we will further rationalise our cost structure to yield sub-$1000 per MT zinc cost of production in the current year.</p>
          <p class="mt-45">I congratulate our employees in achieving excellent results in operations as well as in projects through their persistence and dedication. I would also like to thank all our stakeholders for placing their trust in us and also our regulators for their constant support and guidance.</p>
          <p class="mt-45">Sincerely,</p>
