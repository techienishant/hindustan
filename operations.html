<h3>mines</h3>
<p>We are pleased to inform that our underground mines set a scorching pace of growth, increasing 29% in mined metal terms and 27% in ore terms. With this thrust, we are at the last of our mine expansion plan to take our mined metal production capacity to 1.2 million MT per annum.</p>
</div>

<div class="performance-svg"><img class="img-responsive" src="svg/performance_in-2019.svg"/></div>
<p class="mt-30">During 2019, the Company transitioned to fully underground operations. Ore production was 13.8 million MT in FY 2019, an increase of 9% from a year ago, driven by 27% increase in ore production from underground mines. Mined metal production from underground mine was 936 kt in FY 2019, 29% higher from a year ago on account of higher ore production and better grades, even as the closure of open-cast operations in March 2018 caused total mined metal production to remain marginally down y-o-y</p>

<h3>smelters</h3>
<p>Hindustan Zinc is the fourth largest producer of zinc and lead metal globally with a smelting capacity of 1.08 million MT per annum. We are debottlenecking our smelters to maintain our fully integrated operations as our mines ramp up production.</p>
</div>
<div class="performance-svg"><img class="img-responsive" src="svg/smelting_hzl_overview.svg"/></div>
<p class="mt-30">Chanderiya Lead-Zinc Smelter (CLZS) is one of the largest zinc-lead smelting complexes in the world. Its current metal production capacity is 643,000 MT per annum including 558,000 MT per annum of zinc and 85,000 MT per annum of lead.</p>
<p class="mt-30">The zinc smelter at Dariba Smelting Complex (DSC) was commissioned in March 2010 and has a capacity of 234,000 MT per annum. In July 2011, a lead smelter was commissioned which has been debottlenecked to 120,000 MT per annum.</p>
<p class="mt-30">Zinc Smelter at Debari (ZSD) was commissioned in the year 1968 with an initial production capacity of 18,000 MT per annum. Over the years, ZSD has expanded manifolds to the current capacity of 88,000 MT per annum. ZSD also supplies surplus zinc oxide, an intermediate product, to the Company’s other zinc smelters.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="smelters">
	<div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
    	<p class="mt-30">The smelting complexes are certified for Integrated Management System (IMS) comprising of the Quality Management System (ISO 9001:2015), Environmental Management System (ISO 14001:2015) and Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSAS 18001:2007).</p>
        <p class="mt-30">The silver refinery at Pantnagar in the state of Uttarakhand has been upgraded to produce 800 MT per annum and will process residue and work-in-progress material from smelters at Dariba and Chanderiya. Silver produced at Pantnagar is LBMA certified.</p>
        <p class="mt-30">The Company also has facilities at Pantnagar for processing and refining of zinc and lead cathodes manufactured at its Rajasthan smelters as well as for nationwide distribution of finished goods, making it a centralised finished good centre for its customers. These facilities do not add to the overall smelting capacity.</p>
        <p class="mt-30">Zinc refinery at Haridwar in Uttarakhand and zinc smelter at Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh are currently non-operational.</p>

<div class="performance-svg"><img class="img-responsive" src="svg/perfomance_fy_2019.svg"/></div>
<p class="mt-30">In FY 2019, the Company produced 894,121 MT of zinc-lead metal as compared to 959,708 MT in FY 2018. The decrease was driven by lower availability of mined metal during the year. Zinc production at 696,283 MT was lower by 12% y-o-y due to higher lead ratio in ore. Integrated lead production was a record 1,97,838 MT, higher by 18% driven by higher lead mined metal production and retrofitting of pyro metallurgical smelter to produce more lead.</p>

<div class="op-key-project">
<h3>PROJECT UPDATE</h3>
<p class="mt-30">As part of the ongoing capacity expansion, Smelters are undergoing debottlenecking to achieve capacity of 1.3 million MT per annum over three phases, of which Phase I is complete taking smelting capacity to 1.08 million MT per annum. In Phase I, the increase in zinc production capacity is mainly by increasing cell house productivity and roaster throughput. Lead production capacity was increased by improving the reliability of SKS furnace. Phase II is under progress and nearing completion which will increase production capacity to 1.12 million MT per annum. Phase II involves addition of new cells in zinc smelter and additional lead refining capacity at CLZS increasing zinc and lead capacity by 15 kt per annum each. Additional zinc metal capacity of 18 kt per annum will be provided by overall improvement in cell house performance through new system for anode washing and upgradation of leaching and purification circuit to make the system robust to cater to a wide range of concentrate with better operational efficiency. In Phase III, a Jumbo cell house with leaching & purification circuit and power plant are planned, which will increase smelting
capacity to 1.3 million MT per annum, equivalent to 1.35 million MT per annum mined metal capacity.</p>
<h3>KEY SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES</h3>
</div>

<div class="captive-content">
	<h4>SAFETY INNOVATION CELL</h4>
    <p>In line with Zero Harm vision, a Safety Innovation Cell was formed this year to identify engineering solutions for high risk activities, minimizing
manual activities in material handling and digitisation. Initiatives to eliminate man machine interaction, safe hot metal handling and safe operation in remote area are under implementation.</p>
<h4>IMPROVING ENVIRONMENT PERFORMANCE OF DARIBA LEAD SMELTER</h4>
<p>SKS fume dust leaching system was modified with a new process to control the off-gas dust composition and bleed off the impurities. This has led to reduction in waste generation like dust inventory and improvement in off-gas system reliability as well as equipment life.</p>
<h4>REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT</h4>
<p>To reduce our environment footprint, a zero liquid discharge plant has been ordered at ZSD and CLZS, which will also reduce fresh water intake by 5%; a facility to produce sodium sulphate from RO reject is under construction at DSC and will be operational in first half of FY 2020; and trials for usage of Jarosite in cement plants were done successfully, which on commercialisation will help also reduce cost of production.</p>
<div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">
<div class="row">
	<h4>FUMER PROJECT TO RECOVER METAL LOST IN ZINC
RESIDUE</h4>
    <p>The Company’s first zinc Fumer project with a waste processing capacity of 160,000 MT per annum is expected to commission in FY 2020. The Fumer will lead to annual recovery of valuable metals including 32 MT of silver and 6,200 MT of zinc and lead from zinc residue, which otherwise would be wasted in jarofix. This is also an environment initiative to move towards the goal of zero solid waste and saving 1 hectare of land per annum.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h4>SECOND ANCILLARY PLANT TO AUGMENT ‘WASTE TO WEALTH’</h4>
<p>After successful operation of ‘waste to wealth’ ancillary plant at DSC, a new ancillary unit has commenced construction at CLZS to treat all smelting process residue including work-in-progress material like zinc oxide, copper dross, purification cake, antimony dust and cadmium sponge and is expected to be commissioned in the second half of FY 2020. The plant is expected to generate a cost saving in the range of ₹ 50-75 Crore per annum by producing value added products which will be fed back of our mines and smelters.</p>
</div>

The plant is expected to generate a cost saving in the range of &#8377 50-75 Crore per annum by producing value added products which will be fed back of our mines and smelters.</p>
            <p class="mt-30">Post this modification, current efficiency in cell house of smelter has improved to around 90% from 88% and total zinc loss in Jarosite is reduced to around 2.5% leading to saving of about ₹ 22 Crore per annum at current LME level. With further improvements in automation for finer control of process parameters, current efficiency of upto 92% can be achieved which will lead to additional savings.</p>
            <p class="mt-30">This same process improvement is planned to be replicated at other smelters and total potential savings from this initiative will be more than ₹ 65 Crore per annum.</p>

    	<h3 class="green-heading">KEY OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES</h3>
        <div class="captive-content">
        <h4>RETROFITTING OF PYRO METALLURGICAL SMELTER TO
PRODUCE ONLY LEAD</h4>
<p>Typically, Pyro metallurgical based ISF smelter are designed to produce both zinc and lead metal during processing. This leads to higher cost of production as well as production of lower grade of zinc product. With the objective of enabling pyro metallurgical smelter to have the flexibility of processing both zinc and lead concentrate together or only lead concentrate, the smelter was retrofitted. The plant will now be used primarily to produce lead metal considering higher lead ratio in ore and increasing capacity at hydrometallurgical zinc smelters.</p>
<h4>DEBOTTLENECKING OF ZINC SMELTER</h4>
<p>During the year, several initiatives were undertaken to improve operational efficiencies as well to support debottlenecking of smelters including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Increasing campaign life of roaster and acid plant to 350-days running
time by changing acid plant catalyst and upgrading cooling system</li>
    <li>Improve power consumption of zinc smelters by upgrading
magnesium removal circuit in leaching system to allow for treatment
of high magnesium containing concentrate</li>
    <li>Increase current efficiency in all cell houses by putting three stage
purification in all jumbo hydrometallurgical plants</li>

<h3>exploration</h3>
<p>Our objective is to maintain metal production for over 25 years. To achieve this objective, the Company has an aggressive exploration program focusing on delineating and upgrading Reserve and Resource (R&R) in and around our existing deposits.</p>
</div>
<div class="captive-content">
<p class="mt-30">The exploration team consists of 30 geologists, geophysicists and analysts responsible for designing and executing exploration programs complemented by outsourced service providers. Technology adoption and innovations play a key role in enhancing exploration success. In FY 2019, the Company implemented the latest technologies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The DIAS-32 surface induced polarization geophysical technique which is based on common reference voltage and real time noise rejection for
mapping of lithology, alteration and ore bodies in 3D space</li>
<li>Borehole electromagnetic geophysical surveying (BHEM) which provides 3D information on conductors within a range of ~200m around a
borehole axis. It is used to identify any off-hole conductors which may represent mineralization missed during drilling</li>
<li>Motorized directional drilling (MDD) has been intensively used to enable more targets to be tested more efficiently at less cost. This technique
involves drilling ‘leg’ holes at depth off a mother hole with technical innovation now enabling up to five legs from a single mother hole</li>
</ul>
<p class="mt-30">Exploration success in FY 2019 added to Hindustan Zinc’s R&R providing opportunities for extended mine life and production growth. All the Company’s deposits remain ‘open’ and exploration identified a number of new targets on mining leases having potential to increase R&R over the next 12 months. Across all the sites, the Company increased its surface drilling to 181 km and completed 26 km of underground drilling during the year to assist in upgrading Resource to Reserve.</p>
<p class="mt-30">In line with previous years, the Mineral Resource is reported on an exclusive basis to the Ore Reserve and all statements have been independently audited by SRK (UK).</p>
<p class="mt-30">On an exclusive basis, the Company’s Reserve at the end of FY 2019 totaled 92.6 million MT and Resource totaled 310.4 million MT. Total contained metal in Ore Reserve is 7.3 million MT of zinc, 2.1 million MT of lead and 279 million ounces of silver and the Mineral Resource contains 18.5 million MT of zinc, 6.8 million MT of lead and 685 million ounces of silver. At current mining rates, the R&R underpins metal production for more than 25 years.</p>

<p class="mt-30">A detailed study concluded that roaster throughput can be improved with oxygen enriched air. The Wind-box Oxygen Lancing (WOL) Technology is being implemented at roasters, which will further improve the throughput by 10%.</p>
<h3>INNOVATION</h3>
<p class="mt-30">Conducted feasibility study of ore transportation through pumps, which will be one of its kind in mining industry.</p>
<h3>RELIABILITY CENTRED MAINTENANCE – CRAFTING THE MAINTENANCE</h3>
<p class="mt-30">Asset reliability is one of the key factors that ensures business objectives are achieved. To bring the company performance to the next level in asset maintenance and reliability, RCM concept has been introduced. RCM is all about designing maintenance process to improve system reliability and avoid redundant maintenance. This initiative has significantly contributed during the year with improved productivity and resulted in 50% reduction in unplanned stoppages and 65% improvement in Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) across roasters and beneficiation plants.</p>

	<h5>Drying Tower System Failure Reduction at Roasters</h5>
    <p>Drying tower dries wet SO2 gas with concentrated sulphuric acid through counter flow between the two fluids. RCM analysis was conducted in this system as it was experiencing repeated failures. On carefully understanding its system interaction, it was concluded that the tank level and bearing capacity was forcing the system to behave non-linearly. Both the variables were identified and corrected to maintained system’s reliability. These actions have tackled its failures and have resulted in a two-fold increase in the MTBF.</p>

	<h5>Calcine Drum Cooler - Cooling Water System at RoastersDrying Tower System Failure Reduction at 
Roasters</h5>
    <p>Calcine cooling system was experiencing repeated failure of water leakages. Detailed RCM analysis was conducted, and it was proposed to install a closed loop cooling water circuit to maintain the water quality. As a result, failure was reduced to zero and expected drum cooler life by more than two times.</p>

        	<h5>Logistic Excellence through Integrated
Transport Management</h5>
    <p>Logistic is a key process involving movement of millions of tons of materials across various units of the Company and to the customers. This activity has high business risk in terms of pilferage, safety, and delayed delivery of goods.</p>
    <p class="mt-30">To eliminate this risk through technology and innovation, Integrated Transport Management System (ITMS) has been introduced. The initiative is one of its kind across the country, which has enabled real time tracking of raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods without any
human intervention. Salient features such as route deviation alert, fleet breakdown notifications, have helped reduce the turnaround time. Prior registration of drivers and vehicles have eliminated the risk of unauthorised entry in the premises, thereby improving safety and security. End-to-end processes from loading to unloading has been automated, this includes gate entry, weigh bridges, geo fencing and digitally signed invoicing.</p>
